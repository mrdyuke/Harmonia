Hello, reader. I'm a second-year programming college student from Russia.

This audio player is my learning project, created to practice working with **Vite** and **Electron**, as well as handling audio files in the browser. I developed it with ChatGPT's guidance, to be completely honest.

From a technical standpoint, the application is quite simple and unlikely to compete with modern streaming services — the functionality here is minimal. But I decided to keep it here so that in the future I can look back at my starting point in web development and appreciate my progress.
